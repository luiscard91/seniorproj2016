      <p>"Chicken Tendr is created for those with busy modern life styles impacted by time constraints. We understand that working people have trouble managing their pantry and deciding what to eat. We believe that the two biggest questions people ask themselves concerning this problem is: “What do I have at home?” and “What do I want to eat”. We want people to use their time as efficiently as possible, by taking away the worry of managing a pantry and figuring out what to eat. This web application is focused on keeping track of user’s pantry and suggests recipes that solves both these issues."</p>
